# Banking Account Management System

## Account Class Implementation
**Number 1:**  
This class defines an `Account` with fields for account ID, type, and balance. It includes methods for depositing, withdrawing, getting the balance, and displaying account details.

## Account Test Class
**Number 2:**  
This test class provides a menu-driven interface to interact with an `Account` object, allowing users to deposit, withdraw, display the balance, and exit.

### Overview:
These programs collectively demonstrate the implementation and testing of a basic banking account management system in Java. The `Account` class encapsulates the properties and behaviors of a bank account, while the `AccountMain` class provides a user interface to perform various banking operations. This example highlights the use of classes, objects, methods, and basic input/output operations in Java, simulating a simple banking environment.
